                        advancing a specific area of Mechanical knowledge, learning or technology where mechanical
                        students cooperate to affect or to produce solutions within their particular field of SIG Group.
                        We provide a forum to enhance student’s knowledge in Mechanical Engineering Fields, by involving
                        themselves in mechanical projects. At present, Mechanical Department has SIX SIG’s and ONE club

                    <p> Additive manufacturing SIG aims to provide the students a detailed knowledge of additive
                        manufacturing technique through the avenue of (but not restricted to) 3D printing. The technique
                        includes teaching the SIG students, how to use & construct 3D printers, designing models, parts
                        for 3D printing and CAM processes. This SIG aims to provide the students, the insights of
                        Manufacturing Engineering Techniques, such as design philosophies and how to translate
                        engineering ideas into producible parts and projects. These concepts can be used practically in
                        illustrating the theory taught in the classroom on Additive Manufacturing, and provide valuable
                        experience for career paths in Additive Manufacturing to the students. The Faculty Advisor for
                        this SIG is Mr. Naman Gandhi (Asst. Prof. Mechanical Engineering Department).

                    <p>
                        Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are
                        programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any
                        machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and
                        problem-solving.<br>
                        The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take
                        actions that have the best chance of achieving a specific goal. A subset of artificial
                        intelligence is machine learning, which refers to the concept that computer programs can
                        automatically learn from and adapt to new data without being assisted by humans. Deep learning
                        techniques enable this automatic learning through the absorption of huge amounts of unstructured
                        data such as text, images, or video. The Faculty Advisor for this SIG is Mr. Mukesh Sharma
