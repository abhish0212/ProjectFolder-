                <h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
                <p>Indore Institute of Science and Technology (IIST) offers a four-year under-graduate B. Tech course in
                    Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning which aims to develop a strong foundation by using the
                    principles and technologies that consist of many facets of Artificial Intelligence including logic,
                    knowledge representation, probabilistic models, and machine learning. This course is best suited for
                    students seeking to build world-class expertise in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and
                    emerging technologies which help to stand in the crowd and grow careers in the upcoming
                    technological era.

                    B. Tech. in Artificial Intelligence is an undergraduate program with advanced learning solutions
                    imparting knowledge of advanced innovations like machine learning, often called deep learning and
                    artificial intelligence.<br>
                    The course is designed to give the students enough exposure to the variety of applications that can
                    be built using techniques covered under this program. They shall be able to apply AI/ML methods,
                    techniques and tools to the applications. The students shall explore the practical components of
                    developing AI apps and platforms. Proficiency in mathematics will thrive, as this degree requires
                    strong problem-solving and analytical skills. They shall be able to acquire the ability to design
                    intelligent solutions for various business problems in a variety of domains and business
                    applications. The students shall be exploring fields such as neural networks, natural language
                    processing, robotics, deep learning, computer vision, reasoning and problem-solving. The key
                    objective is to identify logic and reasoning methods from a computational perspective, learn about
                    agent, search, probabilistic models, perception and cognition, and machine learning.<br>
                    This specialization is designed to enable students to build intelligent machines, software, or
                    applications with a cutting-edge combination of machine learning, analytics and visualization
                    technologies. The main goal of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning is to program
                    computers to use example data or experience to solve a given problem. Many successful applications
                    based on machine learning exist already, including systems that analyze past sales data to predict
                    customer behavior (financial management), recognize faces or spoken speech, optimize robot behavior
                    so that a task can be completed using minimum resources, and extract knowledge from bioinformatics
                    data.<br>
                    This program discusses AI methods based in different fields, including neural networks, signal
                    processing, control, and data mining, in order to present a unified treatment of machine learning
                    problems and solutions.

                        learn the fundamentals of Kotlin, Google’s preferred programming language for Android and build
                        interesting
                        applications. Under this SIG training will be provided which will cover the Android components,
                        tools and
                        technologies like multi-screen Navigation, Android Studio, Intents, Fragments, Widgets, Layout
                        and Ionic to
                        build modern applications.</p>

                        opportunities. Here the students are trained for international certifications like Microsoft,
                        Cisco and Red
                        Hat certifications. Students will learn hardware and operating systems for computer networks and
                        train to
                        upgrade troubleshoot and administer the system which will help them prepare for high-paying
