                                        The graduates in Electronics & Communication Engineering first have to
                                        understand the principles of Electronic Devices and Circuits, Network Analysis,
                                        Communication System, Signal & Systems, Digital Electronics, Control System,
                                        Microprocessors and Microcontrollers, VLSI systems, Electromagnetic Theory and
                                        then to use them for analysis, design and implementation of systems to make the
                                        life of mankind comfortable. The teaching of Electronics & Communication
                                        Engineering involves first learning the fundamentals of relevant subjects in
                                        depth and then to understand the complexities of various subjects such VLSI
                                        Design, Advance Communication System, Microprocessor and Micro-controller. The
                                        knowledge so acquired is later used to analyze, design and implement solutions
                                        to the problems which are complex and real time.<br>

                                        It is expected that pass out graduates will acquire sufficient knowledge and
                                        skills required for the continuation of receiving more and more technical
                                        education in order to gather more and more knowledge with a willingness to have
                                        lifelong learning. After acquiring sufficient knowledge in the fundamentals of
                                        engineering practices, experimental and laboratory skills, design, simulation
                                        and software tools for design etc. will make the student a competent Electronics
                                        Engineer. After imparting basic technical knowledge, in- campus training and
                                        workshops as well as industrial visit/tours are provided to the students for
                                        reducing the industry-academia gap. Therefore, the main objective of the courses
                                        offered at the undergraduate level is to build a sound foundation through
                                        fundamentals and then to create strong structures of knowledge in the technical
                                        and multi-disciplinary areas, which in-turn helps in building the professional
                                        ethics and moral values in the graduates.

                    <p>Digital Signal Processing (DSP) is concerned with the representation of signals in digital form,
                        and with the transformation of such signal representations using digital computation. Digital
                        Signal Processing is at the core of virtually all of today’s information technology, and its
                        impact is felt everywhere — in telecommunications, medical technology, radar and sonar, and in
                        seismic data analysis. The SIG focuses on imparting the DSP knowledge and bringing out different
                        projects in the area of digital signal processing.</p>

                    robotics. A lot of it is just too fantastic for people to believe. The goal of teaching robotics is
                    to adopt students to current production process, where the automation technology plays a very
                    important role. However robotics system is considered beyond a working application.<br>
                    Robots have become a popular educational tool in some middle and high schools, as well as in
                    numerous summer camps, raising interest in programming, artificial intelligence and robotics among
                    students
