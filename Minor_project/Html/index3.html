                <h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
                <p>We welcome you to the website of Civil Engineering department at Indore Institute of Science and
                    Technology, IIST was established in 2003 and the Civil Engineering Program is part of the
                    institution since 2012 to offer a Bachelor’s Degree. We are young but fast-growing department with
                    an intake of 60 students. We take great pride in developing skilled civil engineers who are industry
                    ready to cater the needs of modern era. Our department proudly holds dedicated and motivated faculty
                    members with a number of specific sub-disciplines viz. Structural Engineering, Water Resources
                    Engineering, Transportation Engineering and Construction Management. The Department of Civil
                    Engineering with its multifaceted faculty continues to maintain and cultivate its strong links with
                    the infrastructural industry, academic and research institutions both within and outside the State.
                    On a daily basis, civil engineers are touched by many aspects of human life and contribute their
                    knowledge and services in society. From the structures of our homes to designing drinking water /
                    irrigation and environmentally efficient transportation systems or water supply systems, we live in
                    one way or another and are impressed by the work and dedication of civil engineers. Our activities
                    and missions fall into three categories: Teaching, Research and Service. Our students are being
                    prepared to be socially responsible leaders in the field of civil engineering with 360 grooming and
                    holistic development, whether in R & D, higher studies, or to practice as professionals. We
                    encourage you to visit our Campus or explore our website to learn more about the student-centered
                    learning environment to meet global needs.

                    <p> <strong>Civil engineering</strong> is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the
                        design,
                        construction and maintenance of a physically and naturally built environment, including public
                        works such as roads, bridges, canals, dams, airports, sewerage systems, pipelines, structural
                        components of buildings and railways. Emerging trends in civil engineering are building
                        information modeling, earthquake resistant design, smart building, sustainable development,
                        advanced materials and more. It is essential to self-learn and research into these emerging
                        trends. For which special interest groups are formed in our department<br>

                        Self-education is inspired in these special interest groups of the department. Various resources
                        related to student interest have been provided at SIG. It is patronized by teaching faculties
                        and senior students to provide them the opportunity to work in teams. Self-interest and
                        self-learning are motivated in this SIG (Special Interest Group). The CE department has four
                        SIGs through which we offer certified skills courses on the latest research areas and
                        technologies

                    <p>
                        The goal of the institution is to impart knowledge about rainwater harvesting to the students.
                        SIG focuses more on project-based learning in addition to preparing students to face the
                        obstacles that typically come up when applying their technical knowledge. SIG works continuously
                        in projects with students in this domain. Projects include harvesting of roof water, surface
                        water and stormwater which is collected during the rains.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Students will work as industry requires by showing their skills in preparing quantity estimates
                        for building, roads and canal structures as per specification and they can also draft detailed
                        specification and work out Rate Analysis for all works related to Civil Engineering projects.
                        Students will be able to make the construction budgets and schedule the activities related to
                        projects.
