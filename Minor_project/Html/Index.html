        <h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
        <p>Computer Science department comprises a team of highly qualified faculties and technical staff members. Most
          of
          the faculty members are performing research in their respective areas. At present, the computer science
          department
          has a modern computer center with the latest desktop computers and thin client terminals. A salient feature of
          the
          computer center is that it has two blade servers. All the terminals/computers are networked together. The
          department also has networked printing facility and a dedicated leased line to provide internet surfing
          competence
          to the staff and students.</p>

          </div>
          <p>Computer Science is an emerging field which grows and changes very frequently. Fields like Machine
            Learning,
            Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Internet of Things, Cloud Computing, Cyber Security etc. are growing
            exponentially. With this exponential growth in the recent years, there has been a steadily increasing demand
            for bright graduates to come in and help to transform areas ranging from data infrastructure to cyber
            security.</p>
          <p> Self-learning is motivated in these special interest groups of the department. Various resources related
            to
            student interest are provided in the SIG labs. This learning is mentor by faculties and senior students to
            provide them an opportunity to work in team.</p>

        <h3><strong> Carrier Opportunities</strong></h3>
        <p>Computers are used in almost every aspect of life: automobile engines, microwave ovens, video games, watches,
          telephones, laptop computers, medical diagnostic equipment, commercial aircraft, and orbital satellites that
          deliver cable signals around the world. Computers have become tools that perform the immediate, but that’s not
          even quick enough. So, while the computer field is one of the fastest growing segments of industry today, it
          is
          also one of the fastest changing areas technologically.

          Graduates with degrees in computer science or computer engineering might find themselves in a variety of
          environments – academia, research, industry, government, and private or not-for-profit organizations. On a
          daily
          basis, computer professionals are called on to analyze challenges, formulate and test solutions, use advanced
          communications or multimedia equipment, or work in teams for product development. The opportunities are
          enormous. However, an education in computer science and engineering does not stop with a college degree. It
          continues on the job or in the graduate school environment through seminars, conferences, advanced courses,
          and
          training.

          There are a number of career opportunities available in Computer Science and Engineering sector. These
          opportunities are increasing exponentially day by day. Following are a few areas where CS aspirants can build
          their career –</p>
